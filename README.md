### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm ValentÃ­n

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building scalable, user-focused web appsâ€”especially in the education space. I currently work at Universidad Kuepa developing AI-enhanced platforms to support remote learning and student engagement.

- Developing a CRM SaaS for managing student leads and enrollment processes
- Creating a study platform inspired by Google Classroom
- Building and maintaining the university's main landing page
- Integrating AI tools like conversational agents and automation to improve workflows

ðŸŽ¯ I'm always learning and exploring new tools, with special interest in:
- Machine Learning & Data Analytics
- Scalable frontend architectures (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Improving user experiences in education through thoughtful design and performance
